HTML helpers built in PHP for clean and consistent markup

I am a web developer but I mostly work with backend of the application, PHP and MySQL that is.
All the time I have wondered how I can create clean, concise, well structured, minified but easy to maintain HTML.
So I am creating this helper for myself.
